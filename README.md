## What is OD_MTO_DARP?
OD_MTO_DARP is a platform for simulating and solving Dial-a-ride problems.
The platform is fourfold:
###### Population generator:
###### Station assignment problem:
###### Driver assignment problem:
###### Data analysis:
The data analysis tool will help you visualize the solution and get key metrics such 
as the bookings and active stations.

## Documentation
For a comprehensive documentation about the work please check the documentation...
##Usage
This repository contains all project files for an on demand, many to one dial a ride problem.
The repository contains all the files needed from data to algorithm.
## Roadmap
This is the first step of a larger framework that connects **on-demand mobility** with **public transportation** systems. 
- The code is written in Python 3 and will be on continuous improvment to make it faster and protable.
- Integrate real **GPS** mapping and routing using [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend#open-source-routing-machine)
instead of using a graph.
## Contribution 
You are welcome to create a pull request, for major changes and ideas to improve the framework feel free to open a discussion
or send me an [email](ayman.mahmoud@student-cs.fr) to collaborate.
