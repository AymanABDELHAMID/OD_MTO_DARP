abstract = "Ride-sharing facilitates cheap and eco-friendly mobility. In contrast to classical ride-sharing that basically works like a notice-board, dynamic ride-sharing allows a passenger to get a lift on a section of a driver's route and, if necessary, re-routes the driver. On a dynamic ride-sharing platform, drivers provide their routes and passengers specify queries consisting of departure and arrival location as well as a time for the journey. The platform computes suitable matches of driver routes and passenger queries, and proposes them to both parties. State-of-the-Art platforms for public transport routing and dynamic ride-sharing provide unimodal connections but do not combine both transport modes. The challenge is that the driver routes are not static but could be changed significantly if the driver accepts the detour to pick up the passenger and drop him / her off at his / her destination. Thus, a driver's route may result in a number of dynamic ride-sharing offers, namely all possible connections between pick up and drop off points with an acceptable detour for the driver. In this paper, we present a solution that integrates dynamic ride-sharing into our existing multi-criteria intermodal travel information system. We solve two challenges: First, we allow dynamic ride-sharing between two train rides by connecting public transport stations by dynamic ride-sharing offers of drivers. For this, we integrate driver offers into our graph model, which represents the public transport timetable. Second, we find suitable dynamic ride-sharing offers of drivers who can take the passenger from his / her start location to a public transport station or from a station to the queried destination location. In our computational study, compared to unimodal train connections, we obtain a significant improvement of the results by combining public transport and dynamic ride-sharing."

% Multi-modal Route Planning With Public Transport and Carpooling

abstract={Increasing mobility demands raise the pressure on existing transport networks. As the most used mode of transport, private cars have a particularly strong environmental impact and produce congestion. Ridesharing or carpooling, where a driver and several riders form a carpool, can help to address these issues by increasing the number of persons per car. Therefore, recent years have seen a strong interest in carpooling. However, there exists no effective method of integrating carpooling into transport trip planners as of now, mainly due to the fuzzy and flexible nature (e.g., no fixed stops, possibility of making detours) of carpooling. This hinders the acceptance of carpooling by the general public. This paper proposes a new method to merge public transport and carpooling networks for multimodal route planning, considering the fuzziness and flexibility brought by carpooling. It is based on the concept of drive-time areas and points of action. The evaluation with real-world data sets shows that, compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed method merges static (i.e., public transport) and dynamic/fuzzy (i.e., carpooling) networks better, while retaining the desired flexibility offered by the latter, and thus creates a higher interconnectivity between the networks. Meanwhile, the merged network enables multimodal route planning, which can provide users with trips from an origin to a destination using different combinations of modes.},

        abstract = {Millions of people use public transportation and consult electronic timetable information systems. A customer selects from the connections offered by the system according to personal preferences. The chosen connection is typically a compromise based on the importance of several criteria, including departure and arrival time, travel time, comfort and ticket cost. Consequently, multi-criteria optimization should be used to deliver ?attractive? alternatives. We developed the concept of advanced Pareto optimality as an evolution of the classical Pareto optimality approach. It delivers more alternatives and removes unattractive solutions from the results to suit the notion of attractive connections for all potential customers. Realistic modeling of the search for attractive connections leads to shortest-path algorithms. Fast search algorithms are needed to answer customer requests in only a few milliseconds since the schedules are modeled as large graphs (several hundred thousand edges and nodes). The graphs are either time-expanded or time-dependent to model the dimension of time. In contrast to the majority of scientific work on the subject, our approach is fully realistic without simplifying assumptions. We extended the time-expanded graph model to an exact representation satisfying all constraints of a real schedule. Based on a generalization of Dijkstra?s shortest-path algorithm, we developed our full-fledged multi-criteria timetable information system MOTIS (Multi Objective Traffic Information System). It delivers valid connections according to the principle of advanced Pareto optimality. A customer may actually buy a ticket for the connections determined by our system. Furthermore, we also explored the time-dependent model and built a prototype system working on that model as a proof of concept. We also investigated several additional criteria that had not been considered before, for example special offers (reduced ticket cost under certain conditions, e.g. based on the availability of contingents) or the reliability of interchanges, a measure of how likely it is to catch all connecting trains of a trip. Moreover, we present approaches to the search for night trains with the additional objective of ensuring reasonable sleeping times without the need for train changes. Our algorithms respecting these criteria are fast and deliver attractive alternatives. We explored and adapted existing speed-up techniques and developed new ones suitable for our scenario. In an extensive computational study we discuss the cost of regarding the criteria, the effect of various parameterizations of our algorithm, and the impact of the developed speed-up techniques. Applying these, we achieve runtimes of about one quarter of a second on average and solve most of the queries (95\%) in less than a second. Delays occur quite frequently in public transportation. They may invalidate connections as interchanges become infeasible. Current systems do not take that into account. At the utmost, they add changed departure or arrival times to connections calculated according to the static schedule. By incorporating information about delays into our model, we are able to deliver valid connections. We propose a multi-server architecture that allows several search servers to be updated by a central server distributing delay data. The simulation of a whole day with more than 6 million status messages takes less than two minutes. In our architecture, update phases may be scheduled to guarantee the availability of service at all times. We have built user interfaces and visualization tools for our system. Additionally, we have created a new service: proactive route guidance. Within this service a planned trip is registered in CoCoAS (our Connection Controller and Alternatives System). While the passenger travels, the system continously checks the status of the connection. As soon as the system determines that the connection will break, it offers alternatives. By computing these alternatives as early as possible, an asset of our system, more and better options can be explored.},

However, given their highly flexible nature and different pricing structures, previous findings on user groups and environmental impact of station-based car-sharing may not be easily transferable. Therefore, this research uses survey data to compare user groups and usage patterns of a free-floating and station-based car-sharing service both operating in the city of Basel, Switzerland. The findings suggest, that the schemes indeed attract different user groups and are also used differently. Moreover, we see, that car-sharing membership is governed by other factors than car-sharing activity."

	abstract = {Ride-sharing services can provide not only a very personalized mobility experience but also ensure efficiency and sustainability via large-scale ride pooling. Large-scale ride-sharing requires mathematical models and algorithms that can match large groups of riders to a fleet of shared vehicles in real time, a task not fully addressed by current solutions. We present a highly scalable anytime optimal algorithm and experimentally validate its performance using New York City taxi data and a shared vehicle fleet with passenger capacities of up to ten. Our results show that 2,000 vehicles (15\% of the taxi fleet) of capacity 10 or 3,000 of capacity 4 can serve 98\% of the demand within a mean waiting time of 2.8 min and mean trip delay of 3.5 min.Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with \~{3} million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.},

One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated. Research results suggest that the performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and service-related metrics. The estimated SAV average and maximum driven distance prove the importance of vehicle range and charging station deployment."

The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances. }

    abstract = { With the emergence of ride-sharing companies that offer transportation on demand at a large scale and the increasing availability of corresponding demand data sets, new challenges arise to develop routing optimization algorithms that can solve massive problems in real time. In âOnline Vehicle Routing: The Edge of Optimization in Large-Scale Applications,â D. Bertsimas, P. Jaillet, and S. Martin present a novel and generalizable backbone algorithm that uses integer optimization to find high-quality solutions to large routing optimization problems. The algorithm, together with the real-time routing optimization software framework developed and shared by the authors, can dispatch thousands of taxis serving more than 25,000 customers per hour. An extensive study with historical simulations of Yellow Cabs in New York City is used to both show that the algorithm improves on the performance of existing heuristics and to provide insights on the optimization opportunities of a large ride-sharing fleet. }

abstract = "The dial-a-ride problem (DARP) is a widely studied theoretical challenge related to dispatching vehicles in demand-responsive transport services, in which customers contact a vehicle operator requesting to be carried from specified origins to specified destinations. An important subproblem arising in dynamic dial-a-ride services can be identified as the single-vehicle DARP, in which the goal is to determine the optimal route for a single vehicle with respect to a generalized objective function. The main result of this work is an adaptive insertion algorithm capable of producing optimal solutions for a time constrained version of this problem, which was first studied by Psaraftis in the early 1980s. The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and evaluated by means of computational experiments, implying that a significant advantage of the proposed method can be identified as the possibility of controlling computational work smoothly, making the algorithm applicable to any problem size."

The problem arises from an on-demand transportation system developed in a rural zone in France, where the objective of encouraging people meeting is pursued. We address the solution of the problem with a column generation approach, applied to a set partitioning formulation where the objective function is fractional. Based on the literature on linear fractional programming, two methods are developed to deal with this fractional objective. Experiments permit to compare these two approaches and to evaluate the impact of the new objective compared to a standard min-cost or min-time optimization."

    abstract = { This paper presents a taxonomy for classifying vehicle fleet management problems, across several dimensions, to inform future research on autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets. Modeling the AV fleet management problem will bring about new classes of vehicle routing, scheduling, and fleet management problems; nevertheless, the existing literature related to vehicle routing, scheduling, and fleet management is a valuable foundation for future research on the AV fleet management problem. This paper classifies the broadly defined AV fleet management problem by using existing taxonomic categories in the literature; adds additional, or more nuanced, dimensions to existing taxonomic categories; and presents new taxonomic categories to classify specific AV fleet management problems. The broadly defined AV fleet management problem can be classified as a dynamic multivehicle pickup and delivery problem with explicit or implicit time window constraints. Existing studies that fit into this class of fleet management problems are reviewed. New taxonomy categories presented in this paper include fleet size elasticity, reservation structure, acceptâreject decision maker, reservation time frame, ridesharing, vehicle repositioning, underlying network structure, and network congestion. Two goals of the taxonomy presented in this study are to provide researchers with a valuable reference as they begin to model AV fleet management problems and to present novel AV fleet management problems to spur interest from researchers. }
