abstract = "There has been a resurgence of interest in demand-responsive shared-ride systems, motivated by concerns for the environment and also new developments in technologies which enable new modes of operations. This paper surveys the research developments on the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP) since 2007. We provide a classification of the problem variants and the solution methodologies, and references to benchmark instances. We also present some application areas for the DARP, discuss some future trends and challenges, and indicate some possible directions for future research."
