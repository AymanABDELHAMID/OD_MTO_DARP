    abstract = { With the emergence of ride-sharing companies that offer transportation on demand at a large scale and the increasing availability of corresponding demand data sets, new challenges arise to develop routing optimization algorithms that can solve massive problems in real time. In “Online Vehicle Routing: The Edge of Optimization in Large-Scale Applications,” D. Bertsimas, P. Jaillet, and S. Martin present a novel and generalizable backbone algorithm that uses integer optimization to find high-quality solutions to large routing optimization problems. The algorithm, together with the real-time routing optimization software framework developed and shared by the authors, can dispatch thousands of taxis serving more than 25,000 customers per hour. An extensive study with historical simulations of Yellow Cabs in New York City is used to both show that the algorithm improves on the performance of existing heuristics and to provide insights on the optimization opportunities of a large ride-sharing fleet. }
